# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know right away.

Our preference is that you make use of GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature to disclose potential security vulnerabilities in our Open Source Software. 

To do this, please visit the security tab of the repository and click the "Report a vulnerability" button.
